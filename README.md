# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is a scientific approach to designing, developing,testing and maintaing software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering focuses on scientific design and improvement of modern applications while traditional programming only focused on developing functional applications.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1.Planning - defines the reason for requirement of a software application and what is the primary outcome of the software to be developed.
2. Analysis - identifies the various methodologies and steps to follow, also defines the requirements for developing the system.
3. Design - is the coding phase where the application is developd.
4. Testing - checks whether the developed software meets the pre-defined objectives.
5. Installation - The system is implemented toperform its objective.
6. Maintenance - invlves regular patchint to ensure the application is upto-date.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile development is the modern adaptable development involving review of previous phases of SDLC to ensure compatibility and is preferred in a rapidly changin environment while waterfall model is a traditional way of uniterative development and is preferred in static systems.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engineering determines the needs of customers and how to design a software that meets their expectations. It is important in ensuring the developed application is acceptable by the target customers.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity aims at developing a system whose components are dependent. It ensures that the system can continue operating even if one componet breaks down.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit testing - separate pieces of code are checked to ensure they are properly functional.
2. Integration testing - different units are grouped together for testing.
3. Sysrtem testing - all the units are brought together and tested as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing - a sample of target audience use the system to determine its suitability to their needs.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
A version control system tracks a code and manages its changes. A VCS enables collaboration, easy code management. An example is Git.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
A software project manager oversees the SDLC phase and is responsible for collaboration of the different groups in the development team. Large projects are not easy to manage.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the regular scanning af the software and patching additional componebts to ensure the system is upto-date.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
The software must be legitimate and comply to laws governing that region. 
Formation of backdoors and other software vulnerabilities intetionally is prohibited.
Customer loyalty is crucial.
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
